### Project 1 :
Investigate a Relational Database
=======



### Description
In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided.

### Files used
